  ## About Cribl

  Cribl Stream unlocks [data sources](https://docs.cribl.io/stream/sources), including metrics, events, and logs, in an observability pipeline.

  Deploying this quickstart will allow you to add context to your data, by enriching it with information from external data sources, help secure your data, by redacting, obfuscating, or encrypting sensitive fields, and optimize your data, per your performance and cost requirements.
