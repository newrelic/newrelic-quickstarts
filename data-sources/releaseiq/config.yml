  ## What's ReleaseIQ?

  ReleaseIQ is the Unified Enterprise DevOps Platform to Accelerate Software
  Delivery.

  ReleaseIQ is focused on solving the problems of multi-tool, team, and product
  release pipelines.


  For ReleaseIQ intergration with NewRelic, you must have:

  - A New Relic license to be configured in the ReleaseIQ Platform.

  - Configure New Relic in the ReleaseIQ platform Observability tool settings.


  ReleaseIQ features with New Relic

  - Custom Events: During pipeline execution for each step, events with all step
  information is sent to New Relic. To enable this feature, you will need to
  configure a notification to New Relic in each step.

  - Deployment Verification: Deployments can be verified by New Relic based on
  the New Relic policies configured in deploy step of a pipeline. Then based on
  the priority, alerts will be sent back to the ReleaseIQ platform. The progress
  of pipeline to subsequent steps will be based on deployment verification
  result.
