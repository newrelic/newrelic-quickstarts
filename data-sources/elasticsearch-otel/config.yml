description: |
  Our OpenTelemetry Elasticsearch integration collects and sends comprehensive metrics and logs from your Elasticsearch cluster to New Relic, providing complete visibility into your Elasticsearch environment's health and performance. We collect detailed metrics at the cluster, node, and index level, along with system metrics from the host, enabling you to quickly identify and troubleshoot any issues.

  This integration uses the OpenTelemetry Collector with the dedicated Elasticsearch receiver for  metric collection, plus host metrics and log forwarding capabilities for a complete observability solution.
