  ## Windows Certs via Flex
  Using the infrastructure agent and a flex integration you can pull certification expiration using powershell and send the information to new relic to be used in dashboards or alerts.

  Follow the regular flex installation process to add this flex integration to your agents, study the data to confirm if it matches your needs. 

  ## What is Flex
  New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic.
