A [PiHole](https://pihole.net) is a free DNS server utility that runs on a Raspberry Pi (or other inexpensive device) and captures DNS requests before they're sent out of the network, filtering discrete elements that are spam, harmful, or wasteful. The result is a faster and safer network. 

This quickstart monitors the PiHole by leveraging it's built-in API to display information about the type and quantify of network requests being handled. 

This quickstart requires the pihole-detailed.yml file found at [https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/tree/master/examples).
