  ## Atlassian Bitbucket integration

  ### About Bitbucket

  With best-in-class Jira integration, and built-in CI/CD, Bitbucket Cloud is the native Git tool in Atlassian’s Open DevOps solution.

  ### About this integration

  This integration is built around a [Bitbucket Pipe](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines/integrations). This tool will enable you to send CI/CD events into New Relic, where you can monitor your Bitbucket Pipelines.

  With this integration you can monitor:
    - Number of events/pipeline builds
    - Track priority events
    - Real time event log from your pipeline
    - Events and priority events over time
