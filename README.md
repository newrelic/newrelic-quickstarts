**Announcement**: (07/28/2022) We recently made updates to the directory structure. Dashboards and alerts are now stored in their own directories, `dashboards/` and `alert-policies` respectively. For more information on the new structure, see our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

# New Relic One quickstarts

> Only users with full platform access can use the dashboards installed with a quickstart.

New Relic One quickstarts help accelerate your New Relic journey by providing immediate value for your specific use cases. They include:

- Clear instructions for instrumenting your services
- Observability building blocks like dashboards and alerts

All of this is available through our [Instant Observability](https://developer.newrelic.com/instant-observability) open source ecosystem where New Relic developers, partners, and customers contribute their best-practice solutions.
