  # What is Prometheus?

  Prometheus is a free software application used for event monitoring and alerting.

  ## Get started!

  New Relic offers 2 types of Prometheus integrations:

  1. [Prometheus remote_write integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/#remote-write) if you have an existing Prometheus server running.
  2. [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker and Kubernetes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/#OpenMetrics) if you want to directly scrape a Prometheus endpoint.
