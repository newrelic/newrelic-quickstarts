# Description of the pack
description: |+
  This LAMP observability pack allows you to monitor a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
  It includes a specific dashboard to get observability for an entire LAMP stack.

  Observability pack references are currently not yet implemented,
  this means you will have to install the Apache, MySQL and PHP pack to get those dashboards and alerts.
