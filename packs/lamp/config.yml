# Description of the pack
description: |+
  This LAMP observability pack allows you to monitor a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
  It includes a specific dashboard to get observability for an entire LAMP stack.

  NOTE: Observability pack references are currently not yet implemented,
  this means you will have to install the Apache, MySQL and PHP pack to get those dashboards and alerts.
