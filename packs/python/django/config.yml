  ## What is django?

  Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the
  model-template-views architectural pattern.


  ## Get started!

  Leverage community expertise and instantly get value out of your telemetry data. This quickstart automatically instruments django with the New Relic Python agent, and allows you to instantly monitor your Python application with out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts. Further leverage New Relic's APM capabilities by setting up [errors inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/), [transaction tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces/), and [service maps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/introduction-service-maps/).
