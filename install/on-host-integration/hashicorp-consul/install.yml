title: HashiCorp Consul monitoring integration
description: |
  The HashiCorp Consul on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Consul environment to New Relic, where you can see the health of your Consul datacenter environment. We collect data on both the datacenter and agent/node levels.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
