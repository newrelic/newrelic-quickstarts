title: Nginx monitoring integration
description: |
  Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
