title: Cassandra monitoring integration
description: |
  Our Cassandra integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Cassandra database to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Cassandra metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
