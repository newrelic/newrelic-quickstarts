title: Couchbase monitoring integration
description: |
  Our Couchbase integration collects and sends inventory and metric data from your Couchbase cluster to the New Relic platform, where you can quickly see the health of your Couchbase environment. We collect data at the cluster, node, query engine, and bucket level so you can trace a problem to its source.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
