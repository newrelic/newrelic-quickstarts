title: Elasticsearch monitoring integration
description: |
  Our Elasticsearch integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Elasticsearch cluster to our platform, where you can see the health of your Elasticsearch environment. We collect metrics at the cluster, node, and index level so you can more easily find the source of any problems.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
