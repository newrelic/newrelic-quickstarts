title: PostgreSQL monitoring integration
description: |
  The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
