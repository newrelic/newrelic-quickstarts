title: Redis monitoring integration
description: |
  Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length.

  As part of this integration we will install the New Relic Infrastructure agent.
