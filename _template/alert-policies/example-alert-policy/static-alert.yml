# Advanced Signal Settings
# Duration of the time window used to evaluate the NRQL Condition
signal:
  # How long we wait for data that belongs in each aggregation window 
  aggregationDelay: 1200 # seconds
  # The method that determines when we consider an aggregation window to complete so that we can evaluate the signals for violations.
  aggregationMethod: CADENCE | EVENT_FLOW | EVENT_TIMER
  # How long we wait after each data point arrives to make sure we've processed the whole batch.
  aggregationTimer: 1200 # seconds
  # Controls the duration of the time window used to evaluate the NRQL query 
  aggregationWindow: 1200 # seconds; 30 seconds <= x < 15 minutes
  # Option that determines the type of value that should be used to fill gaps (empty windows).
  fillOption: STATIC | NONE | LAST_VALUE # defaults to STATIC
  # If using the static fill option, this value is used for filling.

  # This setting gathers data in overlapping time windows to smooth the chart line, making it easier to spot trends.
