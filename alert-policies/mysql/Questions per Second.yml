name: Questions per Second

description: |+
  This alert is triggered when the current rate of Questions is greater than 2 standard deviations above the baseline for 60s, which could be an early indicator of a saturation problem for your instance.
  It is important to note that this alert is disabled by default and you need to edit the configuration in New Relic One to add a targeted MySQL instance:
  "WHERE displayName = 'MySql Instance Name'"
  This allows the baseline to be calculated against a single instance instead of all running MySQL instances being monitored.
