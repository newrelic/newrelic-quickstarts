# Name of the alert
name: CPU Usage Too High 

# Description and details
details: |+
  This condtion tracks host CPU usage. A high percentage of CPU usage may indicates not enough system resource.

# Type of alert
type: STATIC

# NRQL query
nrql:
  query: SELECT average(system.cpu.utilization) FROM Metric FACET host.id 

# Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE)
valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE

# List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition
terms:
- priority: CRITICAL
  # Operator used to compare against the threshold.
  operator: ABOVE
  # Value that triggers a violation
  threshold: 95
  # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600

  thresholdOccurrences: ALL

# Adding a Warning threshold is optional
- priority: WARNING
  threshold: 75

  thresholdOccurrences: ALL

# Loss of Signal Settings
expiration:
  # Close open violations if signal is lost (Default: false)
  closeViolationsOnExpiration: true
  # Open "Loss of Signal" violation if signal is lost (Default: false)
  openViolationOnExpiration: true 
  # Time in seconds; Max value: 172800 (48hrs), null if closeViolationsOnExpiration and openViolationOnExpiration are both 'false'
  expirationDuration: 1200

# Advanced Signal Settings
signal:
  # Duration of the time window used to evaluate the NRQL Condition
  # Time in seconds; 30 - 900 (Default: 60)

  # Max 20 minutes, multiple of aggregationWindow

# OPTIONAL: Custom violation description sent with JSON payload
description: Identify processes that heavily consumes CPU resources and investigate.  Consider allocate more resources if no specific problematic process can be identified.

# Duration after which a violation automatically closes
# Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day])
