# Name of the alert
name: Flush Latency Threshold

# Description and details
description: |+
  This alert will trigger when the Flush latency for an Elasticsearch cluster's primary shards is >5ms.
  This is measured by: # of Flushes / Time spent on Flushes (ms) for the evaluated time window.
  Increased Flush Latency is an indication that your disks cannot keep up with your cluster's demands and you may need to reconfigure the 'flush_threshold_size' setting to reduce the translog size needed to trigger a flush operation.
