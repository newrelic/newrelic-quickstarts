name: Max Connection Errors per Second

description: |+
  This alert is triggered when there are greater than 1 errors against the max_connections limit in a 5 minute window, which indicates you have requests to your MySQL instance that are failing to connect.
  This setting's default is 501, but can vary based on the underlying resources available to your instance. You can review your current max_connections limit with this query:
  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';
