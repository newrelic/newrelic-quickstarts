  ## Comprehensive monitoring for your Nextcloud server
  You can use New Relic's infrastructure agent to monitor the performance of your Nextcloud server in near real-time, correlate transactions as they move across the app environment, and identify issues to troubleshoot.
  ### Why monitor your Nextcloud server?
  Use the power of our infrastructure monitoring agent and the Prometheus open metric integration to control, monitor, and secure the data on your Nextcloud server. Use our dashboards to get a high-level overview of your server's performance. 
  - See a map of your server's processes to help you track down the source of your issues fast.
  - Use our tools to help you maintain quick throughput and low latency on your server.
  - Check the health of your database, application, server Nextcloud dependencies.

  ### What’s included?
  Use New Relic to monitor and observe your Nextcloud server to:
  - Be alerted on things like excessive heap memory usage and scrape errors.
  - Use dashboards to monitor crucial performance metrics, such as uptime, free space in bytes, total active users, and more.
  - Enable your Nextcloud admins to keep track of the status and operation of your server installations.
