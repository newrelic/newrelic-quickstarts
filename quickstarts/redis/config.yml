  ## A complete Redis monitoring system

  Redis operates in-memory and achieves I/O faster than traditional database systems. It includes several data structures which make it ready to use right out of the box.

  New Relic provides a Redis quickstart which allows you to monitor your Redis instances out-of-the-box.

  ### New Relic - a perfect tool to monitor Redis

  Redis is known for its speed, so ensuring that it stays operating at peak performance is paramount. Slowdowns can lead to a compromised user experience or even a complete application failure.

  [New Relic's Redis monitor](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/redis-monitoring-integration/) provides actionable insights into the health of a Redis system. It supports custom charts, custom queries, and pre-built dashboards are available for those who don’t need custom configurations. All critical performance and health metrics are monitored.

  ### New Relic Redis quickstart features

  Our Redis quickstart include out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts, including data such as:
  - Overview Snapshot (# masters, # slaves) + charts with commands/sec and commands/sec by node
  - Charts showing connected clients, connected clients by node, changes since last save by node, expired keys/second by node, memory used by node, and blocked clients.
  - Charts showing keyspace hit ratio by node, evicted keys/second by node, input bytes/second by node, network I/O per second, and output bytes / second by node.

  ### Value of the Redis quickstart

  The Redis Quickstart provides a visual snapshot of all the key health information related to your Redis nodes and clusters. Monitoring is made easy via the clear, color-coded dashboard which showcases memory usage, network I/O, node health, and much more.

  New Relic provides crucial tools for monitoring your Redis instances. Its Redis monitor supports features such as a visual dashboard complete with charts detailing all critical performance and health metrics relevant to your Redis system.
