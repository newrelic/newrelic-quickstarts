  # What is Synthetics monitoring?
  Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice.

  # What is a Synthetics Endpoint Availability check
  Synthetics Endpoint Availability uses an HTTP client to monitor remote API endpoints (REST, healthchecks, etc) and allows for customisation for your specific environment.
summary: |
  Synthetic API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website.
