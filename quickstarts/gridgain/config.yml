  # What is GridGain?

  GridGain is a unified real-time data platform that is designed to
  tackle speed and scale challenges. It is built on Apache Ignite, a top
  5 ASF project.
  
  ## Getting started

  GridGain exports extensive metrics and this quickstart allows you to
  view them in New Relic. The same steps should also work with Apache
  Ignite. To get started with GridGain, please check out [the
  documentation](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/latest/).

  ## Dashboard

  This quickstart includes a sample dashboard. Note that the widgets
  included are reasonable defaults but will likely need to be updated
  depending on your configuration (persistence), use case (compute,
  caching) and product (snapshots, data center replication).
  
  ## More information

  More information can be found in [our
  documentation](https://docs.gridgain.com). Download GridGain
  [here](https://www.gridgain.com/download) or launch your own cluster
  in the cloud [here](https://portal.gridgain.com).
