  ## Why monitor Databricks

  In the world of big data, Databricks is a mission-critical platform. But
  making sure your workloads are running efficiently, cost-effectively, and
  reliably can be challenging.

  The Databricks Integration from New Relic delivers total visibility for your
  entire Databricks estate, allowing you to troubleshoot, optimize, and connect
  performance directly to cost—all from a single, unified observability
  platform.

  ### Databricks quickstart highlights
