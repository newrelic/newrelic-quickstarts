  ## About Vercel

  Vercel is the platform for frontend developers, providing the speed and reliability innovators need to create at the moment of inspiration.

  We enable teams to iterate quickly and develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences. Vercel has zero-configuration support for 35+ frontend frameworks and integrates with your headless content, commerce, or database of choice.

  ## About this integration

  This integration is the fastest way to jump straight into monitoring your end-to-end development logs. You also have the ability to monitor your APM traces through Open Telemetry.

  ## Vercel dashboard & visualization

  The Overview dashboard will populate with logs from your Vercel projects after you complete integration set up. This customized board provides key log data to provide you with a high-level overview of the performance of your functions.

  ### Core monitoring
