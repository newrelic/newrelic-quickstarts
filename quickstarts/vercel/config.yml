  ## About Vercel

  Vercel is the platform for frontend developers, providing the speed and reliability innovators need to create at the moment of inspiration.

  ## IMPORTANT! - Log parsing Rule

  For the serverless function monitoring, you will need to set-up a quick log parsing rule in order for the data to parse properly into the correct fields. Here are the steps to complete this.

  1. Open your [log viewer in New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/logger)
  2. Select the "Parsing" option under manage data
  3. Select "+Create parsing rule"
  4. Set the query to "source = 'lambda' AND logtype = 'vercel'"
  5. Copy/paste this parsing rule into the parsing logic `%{UUID:requestid}%{DATA}%{BASE16NUM:duration} %{DATA} %{BASE16NUM:billed_duration} %{DATA} %{INT:max_mem} %{DATA} %{INT:used_mem}`
