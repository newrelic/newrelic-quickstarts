  ## What is the Conviva Integration?

  The Conviva integration is a New Relic Infrastructure
  [on-host integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations/)
  that uses the [Conviva v3 Metrics API](https://developer.conviva.com/docs/metrics-api-v3/3e38d9ead39fc-metrics-v3-api-user-guide-beta)
  to pull metrics from Conviva and push them into New Relic as dimensional
  metrics.

  The Conviva integration supports the following Conviva v3 Metrics API
  concepts.

  * [Single metrics and metric groups](https://developer.conviva.com/docs/metrics-api-v3/3e38d9ead39fc-metrics-v3-api-user-guide-beta#single-metrics-and-metric-groups)

  * [Dimensions](https://developer.conviva.com/docs/metrics-api-v3/3e38d9ead39fc-metrics-v3-api-user-guide-beta#dimensions)
  * [Time ranges](https://developer.conviva.com/docs/metrics-api-v3/3e38d9ead39fc-metrics-v3-api-user-guide-beta#time-range)
  * [Interval granularity](https://developer.conviva.com/docs/metrics-api-v3/3e38d9ead39fc-metrics-v3-api-user-guide-beta#interval-granularity)
