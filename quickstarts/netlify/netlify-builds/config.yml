  Netlify is an all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects. Replace your hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, and deployment pipeline with a single workflow. Integrate dynamic functionality like serverless functions, user authentication, and form handling as your projects grow.

  ### Netlify Builds quickstart highlights

  The Netlify Builds quickstart is the fastest way to explore data from the [New Relic Netlify plugin](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/netlify-plugin). Visualize your Netlify performance with a wide selection of dashboards.

  - Get a detailed view of your web application traffic, including page views, load times, sessions, and most popular content
  - Find out more about your visitors. Where are they from? What devices are they using? When do they frequent your application most?
  - View in-depth information about your page rendering, including LCP, CLS, and FID ratings
  - See all your JavaScript errors tagged by deployment
  - Compare deployment statstics and notice trends in failing builds

  Know as soon as an event occurs with alerts.

  - When the number of JavaScript errors increases beyond an allowed threshold
  - If the onError event is triggered and a build fails
  - When page load time degrades beyond two standard deviations from the normal
