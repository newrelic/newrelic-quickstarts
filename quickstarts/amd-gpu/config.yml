title: AMD GPU Monitoring

description: |
  Our AMD GPU integration assists you in monitoring the status of GPUs. 
  This integration leverages our infrastructure agent and the Flex integration, which is seamlessly integrated with AMD SMI utility. 
  It provides you with a pre-built dashboard containing crucial GPU metrics, including GPU utilization, ECC error counts, 
  active compute processes, clock and performance states, temperature, fan speed, as well as dynamic and static information about each supported device.

summary: |
  Monitor AMD GPUs performance and state.
