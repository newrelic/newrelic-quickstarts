  ## What does this integration do?

  This integration allows you to send your Trivy scan results into New Relic vulnerability management to unify your security findings in one place. This integration utilizes the security data API's ability to process Trivy findings in SARIF.

  ### What is the Security Event API?

  New Relic's Security Event API is a way to ingest security scanner data into New Relic's Vulnerability Management platform. 

  ### Get started!

  Start sending events to the Security Event API!

  Check out our Security Event API documentation to setup ingestion of your scanner data into our Vulnerability Management product.

  ### Get a single view of the vulnerability surface area of your software with New Relic Vulnerability Management

  Integrate security findings from Trivy with our native common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) detection and [any other of your assessment tools](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/security-data-api/) for rich, actionable security insights in the context of all of your telemetry data with [New Relic Vulnerability Management](https://newrelic.com/platform/vulnerability-management).

  Create a powerful, unified source of truth for developers, ops and security teams, eliminate silos to address and minimize security blindspots with full-stack context for faster error resolution that eliminates organizational silos.
