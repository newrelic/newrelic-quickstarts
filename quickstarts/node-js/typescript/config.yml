  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for TypeScript
  Microsoft developed the TypeScript programming language, a free and open-source project. In addition to adding optional static typing, it is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript. Its objective is to develop large-scale applications and transform their source code into JavaScript. 

  ## Why monitor TypeScript?
  - Access your TypeScript logs to identify errors in your application.
  - Find performance issues before they happen.
  - Scalable error monitoring without affecting production flow.
  - Maintain a low latency with fast throughput.

  ## What’s included in this quickstart?
  Get these TypeScript monitoring features out of the box with our quickstartquickstar:
  - Understand the health of your with: throughput and error rate data, logs, web transaction time, Apdex score, and more apdex score and more).
  - Correlate TypeScript application metrics with your server’s primary health metrics, like CPU usage, memory, network usage, and disk space.
  - Create high-value baseline alerts that proactively inform developers about the status of their apps.
