  ## IBM MQ performance

  IBM MQ allows independent and potentially non-concurrent applications on a distributed system to securely communicate with each other, using messages.

  The IBM MQ integration allows you to monitor the performance of MQ Objects like channels and queues . The metrics collected include depth of your queues, how much space your queues have for additional messages, and the age of a queue’s oldest message. Analyzing metrics over time allows you to scale your instances accordingly in order to prevent full queues, which can delay message delivery.

  ### IBM MQ quickstart highlights

  The IBM MQ quickstart automatically instruments your IBM MQ infrastructure, and comes pre-built dashboard visualizing:
  - Total of Connections
  - Connections by Queue Manager
  - Total of Errors
  - Errors  by Queue Manager
  - Total of Messages
  - Messages by Queue Manager
  - Messages by Queue
  - Queue Depth
  - Expired messages by Queue
  - Filesystem usage
