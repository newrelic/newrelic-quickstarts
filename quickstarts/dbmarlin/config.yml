  # About DBmarlin
  DBmarlin monitors database performance, tracks changes and helps your databases run fast.

  It provides an easy-to-use and consistent way to monitor CockroachDB, DB2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQL Server, self-hosted or in the cloud.

  It captures SQL statement text and wait events so you can see exactly where the time is spent executing SQL within your database.

  It auto-detects changes to schema objects, database parameters and execution plans so you can see their impact on performance.
