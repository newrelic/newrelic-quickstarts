  ## Comprehensive monitoring for your lighttpd server

  Lighttpd is an open-source web server designed for high-performance situations while staying standards-compliant, secure, and adaptable.

  ### Why monitor your lighttpd server?

  Lighttpd monitoring provides important information to help you construct a complete picture of your web server's performance. This performance data includes uptime, network in bytes and packets, number of connections, and more.

  ### What’s included?

  When you monitor your lighttpd server with New Relic, you get immediate full-stack observability, including:
  - Be alerted on things like average number of connections, average number of requests and high memory usage.
  - Use dashboards to monitor crucial performance metrics, such as uptime, connection state handle request, connection state still alive, networks, requests per second, and more.

   With our infrastructure agent and Flex configuration setup, you can monitor and validate your lighttpd processes. Right out of the box, analyze and capture your server's performance data.
