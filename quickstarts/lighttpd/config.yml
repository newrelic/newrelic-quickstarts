  ## Comprehensive monitoring for your lighttpd server

  Lighttpd is an open-source web server designed for high-performance situations while staying standards-compliant, secure, and adaptable.

  ### Why monitor your lighttpd server?

  Lighttpd monitoring provides important information to help you construct a complete picture of your web server's performance. This performance data includes uptime, network in bytes and packets, number of connections, and more.

  ### What’s included?

  When you monitor your lighttpd server with New Relic, you get immediate full-stack observability, including:
  - Alerts on things like average number of connections, average number of requests and high memory usage.
  - Dashboards to monitor crucial performance metrics such as uptime, connection state handle request, connection state still alive, networks, requests per second, and more.

summary: |
   With our infrastructure agent and Flex configuration setup, you can monitor and validate your lighttpd processes right out of the box: analyze and capture your server's performance data.
