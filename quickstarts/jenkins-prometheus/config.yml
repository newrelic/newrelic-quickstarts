  ## What is Jenkins?
  The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.
  
  ## Jenkins (Prometheus) quickstart highlights
  The New Relic quickstart uses dashboards to proactively monitor your jenkin servers, like:
  - jenkins health
  - jenkins total jobs/successful jobs/failure jobs
  - jenkins last build status
  - jenkins queue rate

  ### Requirements:
  The approach to getting your Prometheus metrics into New Relic differs depending on which integration you use.

  #### Prometheus Remote Write
  1. [Prometheus Server](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)
  2. Enable Prometheus [Remote Write](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/) to New Relic.
  
  you will need to add the scrape configuration to your `prometheus.yml` config file:
  Reload the prometheus configuration and restart the prometheus instance

  `
    - job_name: "jenkins"  
    params:
      format: ["prometheus"]
    metrics_path: "prometheus"
    scheme: "http"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
   `
