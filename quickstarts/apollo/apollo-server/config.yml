  ## What is Apollo Server?

  Apollo Server is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client. It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.

  You can use Apollo Server as:

  - A stand-alone GraphQL server, including in a serverless environment
  - An add-on to your application's existing Node.js middleware (such as Express or Fastify)
  - A gateway for a federated graph
