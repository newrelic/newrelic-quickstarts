 ## What is Etcd?

 Etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node

 ## Quickstart details

 This quickstart was built based on `etcd` metrics sent to New Relic using Prometheus remote write.  If using with the Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, the dashboard widgets will require some modification.
