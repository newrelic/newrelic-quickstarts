  [Cockroach Database ](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/  ) CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and strongly-consistent key-value store. It scales horizontally; survives disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention; supports strongly-consistent ACID transactions; and provides a familiar SQL API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data.

  Install this quickstart to access preconfigured CockroachDB observability solutions based on Prometheus metrics that are available out-of-the-box.
