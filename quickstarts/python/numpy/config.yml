  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for NumPy

  Monitor your NumPy applications, and analyze performance bottlenecks while operating in a live development environment.Full support for popular frameworks including Flask Visually monitor your web user experience across the world with your application rendition via dashboard.

  ## Why monitor NumPy?

  An ideal NumPy monitoring tool can proactively capture, analyze, trace, and display information related to Python-developed applications.

  An ideal NumPy Performance Monitor must offer comprehensive and actionable information that software developers need to troubleshoot python applications successfully. Some key components are:

  - Get end-to-end visibility into your NumPy application environment and all the dependencies
  - Reduce NumPy application downtime and detect the errors along with exceptions
  - Manage performance of homogeneous datasets and heterogeneous databases in context with your NumPy monitoring
  - Visually understand how a database is impacting your application
  - Assess the visibility of the underlying server infrastructure in relation to your NumPy monitoring
  - Compare the performance of your NumPy transactions
  - Visually analyze the performance of NumPy applications using New Relic’s easy to use dashboard

  ## What’s included in this quickstart?

  New Relic's NumPy monitoring quickstart boasts instant full-stack observability out-of-the-box:
  
  - Alerts (Adpex score,WSGI Response, transaction error and Requests)
  - Easy to use Dashboards (most popular transactions, average transaction duration today compared with that for the previous week, Apdex score comparisons, and more)
  - Monitor NumPy Elements and functions
  - Understand infrastructure resource consumption of application performance
  - Alerts that proactively report end users about the quality of their application

summary: |
  Get a comprehensive understanding of performance with customized dashboards including total requests, total logins, web transactions, and more with New Relic’s NumPy monitoring tool.
