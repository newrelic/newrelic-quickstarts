  ## What is AWS Billing?

  The AWS Billing console provides features to manage and report your AWS cost and usage based on user-defined methods. With this, you can easily understand your AWS spending, pay invoices, analyze and control costs, manage billing preferences and tax settings, and access other cloud financial management services.
