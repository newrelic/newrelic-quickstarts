  ## What is AWS Chatbot?
  AWS Chatbot is an AWS service that enables DevOps and software development teams to use messaging program chat rooms to monitor and respond to operational events in their AWS Cloud. AWS Chatbot processes AWS service notifications from Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and forwards them to chat rooms so teams can analyze and act on them immediately, regardless of location.
