  # What is Puppet?
  Puppet is the industry standard for IT automation. Modernize, manage and bring your hybrid infrastructure into compliance through Puppet's powerful continuous automation.

  # What does New Relic provide
  New Relic has developed a Puppet module for the Puppet agent to deploy the [New Relic Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring/), [New Relic Application Performance Monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/configure-new-relic-agents/) and [On Host Integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations) throughout your environment.

  # How to get started?
  Follow the instructions on New Relic documentation: [Configure the infrastructure agent using Puppet](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/config-management-tools/configure-infrastructure-agent-puppet)
