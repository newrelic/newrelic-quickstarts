  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for Flutter Android
  
  Monitor your Flutter applications and analyze performance bottlenecks while operating in a live development environment. You can use this dashboard to visualize your web user experience with your application rendition.
  
  ## Why monitor Flutter Android?
  Monitoring app performance allows you to avoid crashes, bugs, or user complaints by taking a preventative approach rather than waiting until an issue arises. With New Relic Android and Flutter agents, you can track important metrics such as network failures, HTTP response times, slow launches, and custom traces.

  You can optimize the process once you have a comprehensive picture of all releases by prioritizing active issues and marking errors as corrected. Identify the release in which the problem first appeared, merge duplicates, and assess whether the issue may worsen. Send deploy emails instantly with commit information, and suggest an owner for each application error.

  ## What’s included in this quickstart?
  New Relic Android and Flutter monitoring agents capture the following metrics:
  
  - Get alerted when critical issues affect your Flutter application
  - Dashboards (error rate, app launches, app installations, app crashes and more)
  - Monitor Flutter Dart exceptions and errors
  - Monitor HTTP responses & errors, and mobile events
