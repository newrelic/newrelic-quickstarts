  ## Why eBPF?
  eBPF is a technology embedded within the Linux kernel that allows developers to execute custom, sandboxed programs within the kernel space. It is a versatile tool that extends the capabilities safely of the Linux kernel without requiring changes to the kernel source code.

  The New Relic eBPF agent is an integration of the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology into New Relic's platform. The eBPF agent offers a new method for monitoring services, allowing customers to monitor their services without the need for language-specific agents. The eBPF agent collects data directly from the kernel, providing valuable insights into the performance of services running on the Kubernetes cluster.

  ## eBPF quickstart highlights
  The New Relic eBPF quickstart automatically instruments your services and includes pre-built dashboards visualizing:
  DNS resolution
  Bytes sent/received
  TCP connections
