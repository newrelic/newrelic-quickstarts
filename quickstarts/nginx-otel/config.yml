  ## How to monitor NGINX with New Relic?
  The OpenTelemetry nginxreceiver collects metrics from your running NGINX instances. These metrics provide insights into connections, requests, client errors, server errors, and more.
  A New Relic entity will be created for each NGINX instance, allowing you to easily explore, configure alerts, and compare metrics for all your NGINX servers in one place.
  Our monitoring quickstart includes a pre-built dashboard that displays aggregated metrics from all of your NGINX instances, with the ability to filter the data for specific analyses.
