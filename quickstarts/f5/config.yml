  ## What is F5?

  ## Get started!

  Use New Relic's F5 BIG-IP integration to collect and send inventory and metrics from your F5 BIG-IP instance, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics.

  We collect data at the system, application, pool, pool member, virtual server, and node levels.
