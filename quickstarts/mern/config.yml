  ## Comprehensive MERN Stack Monitoring System
  A JavaScript-based open-source framework called MERN Stack is used for creating dynamic web pages and online applications. There are four components in the stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS. 
  The stack's components integrate logically and simply because they are all based on JavaScript and JSON. These four powerful technologies all play an important role in the creation of web applications.

  ## What should you look for in a MERN dashboard?
  - Metrics related to MongoDB including active connections, database details, usage time, and more.
  - There are many metrics available for ExpressJS and NodeJS including web transactions, top ten transactions and errors, memory usage, and many others.
  - There are many different ReactJS metrics including the number of viewed urls, page views by city, ajax requests, etc. You may also create your own chart using the collected metrics.

  ## What’s included in the MERN quickstart?
