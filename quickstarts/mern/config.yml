  ## Comprehensive MERN Stack Monitoring System
  MERN Stack is a widely used open-source framework that is based on JavaScript and is used to create dynamic web pages and online applications. The framework comprises of four components, namely MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS, all of which play a vital role in the development of web applications. These four technologies integrate seamlessly and logically, making it easy to build web applications using the MERN Stack. Each of these components is based on JavaScript and JSON, which makes the integration process simpler and more efficient.

  ## What should you look for in a MERN dashboard?
  - MongoDB metrics such as active connections, database details, and usage time
  - For ExpressJS and NodeJS, there are a variety of metrics available, including web transactions, top ten errors, and memory usage
  - ReactJS metrics include page views by city, ajax requests, and viewed urls. Additionally, you can create your own chart based on the metrics collected
