  ## About Hardware Sentry
    Hardware Sentry is Sentry Software's native OpenTelemetry solution which monitors the hardware health of almost any server, storage system, and network switch available on the market and exposes the collected metrics into New Relic. The solution also reports on power consumption, electricity costs and CO₂ emissions of on-prem IT infrastructures.

    The solution is free-to-use for New Relic users. [Support plans](https://sentrysoftware.com/pricing/) are available.

  ## About this integration
    This integration with New Relic & Hardware Sentry connects the native OpenTelemetry collector in Hardware Sentry's agent to New Relic's observability monitoring platform.

  ### Monitoring the health of your on-prem IT infrastructure in New Relic
    The monitoring available with this integration gives you full visualization into your on-prem IT infrastructure.

    - Monitor the health of your hardware resources, including processors, memory modules, disks, network cards, and more.
    - Monitor and assess the CO₂ emissions linked to the energy consumption of your data centers.
    - Evaluate the energy efficiency of your various data centers daily, monthly, or yearly based on collected power consumption metrics (no smart PDUs needed).
    - Identify the optimal temperature for your data centers through real metrics and data-driven suggestions. Estimate potential savings by considering a slight increase in temperature.

summary: |
  Hardware Sentry provides insight into your hardware health, performance metrics, and sustainability indicators of your infrastructure.
