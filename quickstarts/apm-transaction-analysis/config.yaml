  ## Why use this dashboard?
  Normally in the curated APM view you will see one application at a time.  When you have hundreds of applications and wish to analyze the relative performance accross apps, this view excels.
  Using the power of NRQL we present a unified drill down of performance that is very useful when setting up alert conditions and service levels.  It is very good at helping explore performance outliers.
summary: |
