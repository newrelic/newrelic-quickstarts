  ## About New Relic Prometheus Agent
  
  New Relic created the [Prometheus Agent](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator) in order to simplify the experience of configuring features like discovery, filtering, metrics decoration, and sharding. 
  
  It generates a configuration file that is used to run a Prometheus Server in Agent mode to later send the metrics to the New Relic Remote Write Endpoint.
  
  ## About the Quickstart
  
  You can use this Quickstart dashboard to get insight into the performance of your Prometheus Server instances and the metrics volume sent to New Relic.
