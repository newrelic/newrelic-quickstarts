summary: Integrate Lacework's security events into the New Relic platform
description: |
  ## Lacework introduction

  Lacework is a comprehensive cloud security platform. We aim to turn security into a data problem and replace the frictionful processes for things like breach investigations or achieving compliance standards with simple, contextualized workflows.

  Technically, our approach is that we replace the traditional 'rules' based mentality that requires you to predict attacker patterns ahead of time with a fully ML based approach.  We baseline what normal user, application and network behaviors look like across your workloads and cloud accounts automatically and then only alert you to deviations from the norm.  This significantly reduces the amount of toil in setting up and maintaining our solution, but also drastically improves the efficacy and amount of security alerts you will receive.

  This integration with Lacework and New Relic brings the curated security alerts for misconfigurations and anomalous security behaviors into the New Relic platform so you can easily triage against your wealth of observability data or easily transition from monitoring to security investigations from a single interface!
