  # About Kentik
  Kentik is a Network observability platform that gives you all the information and tools to monitor your network infrastructure.

  ## About this integration
  This integration gives you visibility into data ingested via the Kentik Firehose. The data is sent to Kentik and enriched before being sent to New Relic. There are also a few relevant alert examples included.
  Deploying this quickstart gives insights into the following:

  - Network Syslog
  - Network Synthetics
  - Performance Telemetry
