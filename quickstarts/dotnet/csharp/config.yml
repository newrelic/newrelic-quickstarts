  - Focus on the issues that affect your critical business transactions
  - Resolve problems quickly
  - Gain knowledge on your system's behavior in advance
  - Learn the whole story of performance errors, from beginning to end
  - Use traces to connect latency issues to errors, getting you to the root cause as quickly as possible
  - See the filename and line number of the C# stack trace so you never have to guess. To reduce noise, logically filter and aggregate C# exceptions.
